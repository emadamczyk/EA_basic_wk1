# EA_basic_wk1

I reworked this assignment through multiple iterations over this past week and a half and found it to be useful practice on a variety of concepts. I did both the "easy" and "recommended" assignments and found them both helpful. Each led to me testing code separately to experiment with the results I would get using different elements and/or styles. That was the most helpful. At some point, I did get the pages to look as recommended; I am sure there are other ways and I continue to experiment with other ways to code (and learn). 

I added a few bonus elements -- like the hover effects to links/placeholder links.
I also added a sticky footer with calc().

Final tweaks included adjusting my code to eliminate unnecessary spacing and indentations.

On the Portfolio page I used absolute positioning to position each box in the gallery of image boxes. I also used absolute positioning for the caption that appears over each image box. In a separate experiment I was successfully able to get the caption to be positioned relatively to its parent image; however, in the homework the use of images and text I think further complicated that code. I understand that applying bootstrap to this page will help with the positioning of all these elements. 

Overall, I enjoyed creating this site that I will continue to tweak. It led to lots of curious coding that happened alongside this whole process.
