# EA_basic_wk1

I reworked this assignment through multiple iterations over this past week and a half and found it to be useful practice on a variety of concepts.

I added a few bonus elements -- like the hover effects to links/placeholder links.
I also added a sticky footer with calc().

Final tweaks included adjusting my code to eliminate unnecessary spacing and indentations.
